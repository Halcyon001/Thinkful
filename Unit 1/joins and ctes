1. What are the three longest trips on rainy days?

with
	rain
as (
	select
		date
	from
		weather
	where
		events like 'rain'
	group by date
)

select
	trip_id,
	duration
from
	trips
join
	rain
on
	rain.date = date(trips.start_date)
order by duration desc

2. Which station is full most often?

select
	stations.name,
	count(trip_id)
from
	stations
join
	trips
on
	trips.start_station = stations.name
group by stations.name
order by count(trip_id) desc

The top three stations returned from the above table are the stations with the most trips, making them the busiest stations

3. Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips starting at that station but ordered by dock count.

select
	stations.name,
	count(*) number_of_trips,
	stations.dockcount
from
	stations
join
	trips
on
	trips.start_station = stations.name
group by stations.name
order by stations.dockcount desc

4. (Challenge) What's the length of the longest trip for each day it rains anywhere?

select
	max(trips.duration) longest_trip,
	weather.Date
from
	trips
join
	weather
on
	date(trips.start_date) = weather.Date 
group by weather.Date
