I used a table of airbnb listings from washington dc

1. What's the most expensive listing? What else can you tell me about the listing?

select name, host_name, neighbourhood, room_type, price, minimum_nights
from listings
order by price desc, minimum_nights desc;

The most expensive listing is the "Rare Close-In Capitol Hill Condo for Inauguration," owned by "Rachel," in the	"Union Station, Stanton Park, Kingman Park" neighborhood.
The rental area is an entire home/apt, and has a price of	$999 per night, with a minimum required stay of 3 nights.
There are other airbnbs with a price of 999$/night, but this is the only one that requires you stay 3 nights, which makes it the priciest.

2. What neighborhoods seem to be the most popular?

select neighbourhood, count(*) number_of_listings
from listings
group by neighbourhood
order by number_of_listings desc

The most popular neighborhoods appear to be:
"Columbia Heights, Mt. Pleasant, Pleasant Plains, Park View" - "803" listings
"Union Station, Stanton Park, Kingman Park" - "762" listings
"Capitol Hill, Lincoln Park" - "683" listings
"Dupont Circle, Connecticut Avenue/K Street" - "558"
"Edgewood, Bloomingdale, Truxton Circle, Eckington" - "536"
"Shaw, Logan Circle" - "530" listings


3. What time of year is the cheapest time to go to your city? What about the busiest?

select listing_id, calendar.date, count(*) taken_dates
from calendar
join listings
on calendar.listing_id = listings.id
where calendar.available like 't'
group by strftime('%m', calendar.date)
order by count(*) desc
-- the resulting table shows the number of occupied spaces per month

The busiest time of year is the summer months/beginning of fall, according to the airbnb data, the months from june-october have the most activity
