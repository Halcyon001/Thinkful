DRILL:Â¶
Let's say we work at a credit card company and we're trying to figure out if people are going to pay their bills on time. We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be useful? Write up your thoughts in submit a link below.

We have data on individuals' spending in 4 categories, and presumably past data of whether or not they have paid their bills on time. We could construct a 4 dimensional KNN model with each of the 4 predictors. In this case, all of the variables are measured in the same units: dollars, so I don't believe any rescaling is necessary. Trying to normalize the data may be a bad idea anyway, since if we used a measure like z-scores, it may throw off the model because there might be a lot of outliers. I think, because of the variance in the data, that it might be a good idea to weight by distance in order to improve the models handling of outliers and above average data points. KNN may be a good model for this task since human behaviors are probably similar within a population.
